<h1>Data Structure and Algorithms</h1>
<h2>Data structures :-</h2>
<h3>A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. For example, we can store a list of items having the same data-type using the array data structure. This page contains detailed tutorials on different data structures (DS) with topic-wise problems.</h3>

<h2>Algorithms :-</h2>
<h3>In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.</h3>

<h2>Types of Data Structure :-</h2>
<h3>There are two fundamental kinds of data structures: array of contiguous memory locations and linked structures.</h3>

<h2>Advantages of Data Structure :-</h2>
<h3>Data structures allow information storage on hard disks. provides means for management of large dataset such as databases or internet indexing services. Are necessary for design of efficient algorithms. allows safe storage of information on a computer.</h3>
