<h1>1.Doubly Linked List</h1>
<h2>In computer science, a doubly linked list is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains three fields: two link fields (references to the previous and to the next node in the sequence of nodes) and one data field.</h2>
<h1>2 .Uses of Doubly Linked List</h1>
<h2>Doubly linked list allows element two way traversal. On other hand doubly linked list can be used to implement stacks as well as heaps and binary trees. Singly linked list is preferred when we need to save memory and searching is not required as pointer of single index is stored.</h2>
