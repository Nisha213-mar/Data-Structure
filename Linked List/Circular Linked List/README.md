<h1>Circular Linked List</h1>
<h2>Circular linked lists (singly or doubly) are useful for applications that need to visit each node equally and the lists could grow. If the size of the list if fixed, it is much more efficient (speed and memory) to use circular queue. A circular list is simpler than a normal doubly-linked list.</h2>

<h1>What is circular Linked List Advantages :-</h1>
<h2>Advantages of a circular linked list. Some problems are circular and a circular data structure would be more natural when used to represent it. The entire list can be traversed starting from any node (traverse means visit every node just once) fewer special cases when coding(all nodes have a node before and after it)</h2>

<h1>Difference between Linked List and Circular Linked List :-</h1>
<h2>A circular linked list is a variation of a singly linked list. The only difference between the singly linked list and a circular linked list is that the last node does not point to any node in a singly linked list, so its link part contains a NULL value. ... The circular linked list has no starting and ending node.</h2>
