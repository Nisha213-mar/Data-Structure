<h1>What is Balanced BT :</h1>
<h3>Binary tree where the difference between the height of left subtree and right subtree **for every node** is not more than k(usually k=1). This difference is called balanced factor. **bf=|height of LST - height of RST</h3>
<h3>So for every node **height of LST - height of RST** should be {-1,0,1}.</h3>
<h1>AVL Tree :</h1>
<h3>AVL Tree is a self-balancing BST (i.e., basically a BST which remains balanced even though you insert or delete nodes).</h3>
<h1>Ways of Balancing AVL Tree</h1>

<h2>To maintain the balance in AVL Tree(i.e to be AVL tree always) while inserting and deleting, we perform Rotations. Depending on different imbalance cases, we have 4 basic types of rotations â€“</h2>

- **LEFT LEFT Imbalance/case - RIGHT Rotation**
- **RIGHT RIGHT Imbalance/case - LEFT Rotation**
- **LEFT RIGHT Imbalance/case - LEFT RIGHT Rotation**
- **RIGHT LEFT Imbalance/case - RIGHT LEFT Rotation**
