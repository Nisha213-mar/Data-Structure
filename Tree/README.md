<h1>Tree Data structure :</h1>
<h2>Tree is a hierarchical data structure which stores the information naturally in the form of hierarchy style. Tree is one of the most powerful and advanced data structures. It is a non-linear data structure compared to arrays, linked lists, stack and queue. It represents the nodes connected by edges.</h2>
<h1>Basic Terminology In Tree Data Structure:</h1>

<h2>Parent Node: The node which is a predecessor of a node is called the parent node of that node. {2} is the parent node of {6, 7}.</h2>
<h2>Child Node: The node which is the immediate successor of a node is called the child node of that node. Examples: {6, 7} are the child nodes of {2}.</h2>
<h2>Root Node: The topmost node of a tree or the node which does not have any parent node is called the root node. {1} is the root node of the tree. A non-empty tree must contain exactly one root node and exactly one path from the root to all other nodes of the tree.</h2>
<h2>Degree of a Node: The total count of subtrees attached to that node is called the degree of the node. The degree of a leaf node must be 0. The degree of a tree is the degree of its root. The degree of the node {3} is 3.</h2>
<h2>Leaf Node or External Node: The nodes which do not have any child nodes are called leaf nodes. {6, 14, 8, 9, 15, 16, 4, 11, 12, 17, 18, 19} are the leaf nodes of the tree.</h2>
<h2>Ancestor of a Node: Any predecessor nodes on the path of the root to that node are called Ancestors of that node. {1, 2} are the parent nodes of the node {7}</h2>
<h2>Descendant: Any successor node on the path from the leaf node to that node. {7, 14} are the descendants of the node. {2}.</h2>
<h2>Sibling: Children of the same parent node are called siblings. {8, 9, 10} are called siblings.</h2>
<h2>Depth of a node: The count of edges from the root to the node. Depth of node {14} is 3.</h2>
<h2>Height of a node: The number of edges on the longest path from that node to a leaf. Height of node {3} is 2.</h2>
<h2>Height of a tree: The height of a tree is the height of the root node i.e the count of edges from the root to the deepest node. The height of the above tree is 3.</h2>
<h2>Level of a node: The count of edges on the path from the root node to that node. The root node has level 0.</h2>
<h2>Internal node: A node with at least one child is called Internal Node.
Neighbour of a Node: Parent or child nodes of that node are called neighbors of that node.</h2>
<h2>Subtree: Any node of the tree along with its descendant</h2>
