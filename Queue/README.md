<h1>Queue :-</h1>
<h2>Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.</h2>

<h1>Example of Queue :-</h1>
<h2>The simplest example of a queue is the typical line that we all participate in from time to time. We wait in a line for a movie, we wait in the check-out line at a grocery store, and we wait in the cafeteria line (so that we can pop the tray stack). ... Computer science also has common examples of queues.</h2>
<h1>Types of Queue :-</h1>
<h2>There are four different types of queues:</h2>
<h3>Simple Queue.</h3>
<h3>Circular Queue.</h3>
<h3>Priority Queue.</h3>
<h3>Double Ended Queue.</h3>
<h1>Application of Queue :-</h1>
<h2>Serving requests on a single shared resource, like a printer, CPU task scheduling etc. In real life scenario, Call Center phone systems uses Queues to hold people calling them in an order, until a service representative is free. Handling of interrupts in real-time systems.</h2>
