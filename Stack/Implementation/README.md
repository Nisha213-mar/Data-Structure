<h1>Postfix :-</h1>
<h2>The Postfix notation is used to represent algebraic expressions. The expressions written in postfix form are evaluated faster compared to infix notation as parenthesis are not required in postfix. ... Following is algorithm for evaluation postfix expressions. 1) Create a stack to store operands (or values).</h2>
<h2>Example :</h2>
<h3>There are many real-life examples of a stack. Consider an example of plates stacked over one another in the canteen. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed, i.e. the plate which has been placed at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest period of time.</h3>
<h1>prefix :-</h1>
<h2>An expression is called the prefix expression if the operator appears in the expression before the operands. ... Postfix: An expression is called the postfix expression if the operator appears in the expression after the operands. Simply of the form (operand1 operand2 operator)</h2>
<h2>Example :-</h2>
<h3>Expression conversion is the most important application of stacks. Given an infix expression, it can be converted to both prefix and postfix notations. ... Infix notation ( a operator b ): For example, a + b is an infix notation. Prefix notation ( operator a b ): + a b is the equivalent prefix notation of a + b</h3>
<h1>Infix :-</h1>
<h2>The expression of the form a op b. When an operator is in-between every pair of operands. Postfix expression: The expression of the form a b op. When an operator is followed for every pair of operands</h2>
<h2>Example :</h2>
<h3>(A + B) * (C + D)</h3>
